                            should
                            monitor whether the
                            first days of her periods tend to come the same number of days apart every month, which is
                            considered regular <a class="showbtn"> read more...</a></h4>
                        <p class="text-hidden para" id="read-more">Conversely, your periods may be irregular, meaning
                            yuor cycle lengths vary from month to
                            month.
                            By
                            tracking this information on a calendar, you can better get hold of your ovulation period,
                            which is the time when your ovaries will release an egg every month.

                            A woman's egg is fertile for only 12 to 24 hours after its release, according to the
                            American
                            Pregnancy Association. However, a man's sperm can survive in a woman's body for up to five
                            days.

                            guesswork out of figuring out when a woman is ovulating. Sold at drug stores, the kits test
                            urine for luteinizing hormone, a substance whose levels increase each month during ovulation
                            and cause the ovaries to release an egg.
